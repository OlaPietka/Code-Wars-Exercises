# Code Wars Exercises 
## Description
In this repository there are few exercises from the [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) page.

## Description and content of the tasks
### **Anagrams**
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

"Write a function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list. You will be given two inputs a word and an array with words. You should return an array of all the anagrams or an empty array if there are none."   

### Hamming Numbers 
A **Hamming number** is a positive integer of the form 2<sup>i</sup>3<sup>j</sup>5<sup>k</sup>, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.

"Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.
Your code should be able to compute all of the smallest 5,000 Hamming numbers without timing out."

### Isograms
An **isogram** is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. 

"Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case."

### Matrix determinant
"Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant of the matrix."

### Primes in numbers
"Given a positive number n > 1 find the prime factor decomposition of n. The result will be a string with the following form:
`(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)` 
with the p(i) in increasing order and n(i) empty if n(i) is 1."

### Rectangle rotation
"A rectangle with sides equal to even integers a and b is drawn on the Cartesian plane. Its center (the intersection point of its diagonals) coincides with the point (0, 0), but the sides of the rectangle are not parallel to the axes; instead, they are forming 45 degree angles with the axes.
How many points with integer coordinates are located inside the given rectangle (including on its sides)?"

### Sort binary tree
"Your task is to return the list with elements from tree sorted by levels, which means the root element goes first, then root children (from left to right) are second and third, and so on.
Return empty list if root is None."

### Sudoku solver
"Write a function that will solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The function will take one argument consisting of the 2D puzzle array, with the value 0 representing an unknown square."


### Sum of odd numbers
"Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
            ...
Calculate the row sums of this triangle from the row index (starting at index 1)."
